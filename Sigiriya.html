      <h2>History of Sigiriya</h2>
      <p>Sigiriya, also known as Lion Rock, is an ancient rock fortress built in the 5th century AD by King Kasyapa (477-495 AD). The king chose this dramatic location for his new capital, constructing a palace on the summit and decorating the rock face with colorful frescoes.</p>
      
      <h3>The Story of King Kasyapa</h3>
      <p>King Kasyapa seized the throne after killing his father, King Dhatusena. Fearing retaliation from his brother Moggallana, the rightful heir, Kasyapa built his fortress on the impregnable Sigiriya rock. After 18 years, Moggallana returned with an army, and Kasyapa was defeated in battle. The site was later converted into a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century.</p>
      
      <h3>Archaeological Discovery</h3>
      <p>Sigiriya was largely forgotten until British archaeologist H.C.P. Bell began excavations in the late 19th century. Major restoration work was undertaken in the 1980s, and today it stands as one of Asia's most important archaeological sites.</p>
